# mappy

Sample application used to test and develop map functionalities via Mapbox.

## Usage

Before building the application, you need to provide a `config.json` file in the `assets` directory which hosts your Mapbox API key.

```json
{
  "mapbox_api_token": "XXX",
  "mapbox_style_url": "XXX"
}
```
